	<h3>Look after yourself and your friends</h3>

	<ul>

		<li><strong>Look out for your friends</strong> - Don’t leave your mates on their own. Make it easy for them to look after you by sticking with them or letting them know where you’re going.</li>
		<li><strong>Be yourself</strong> - If you don't feel like another drink or want to drink at your own pace speak up, real friends should respect that.
		<li><strong>Plan your way home</strong> – Before you go out discuss with your friends who is going to be the designated driver. If no-one wants to drive make sure you have enough money to get a taxi home. Remember drinking and driving doesn’t mix, not for you and not for your friends. Make sure your driver knows that it is not OK to drink if they have been designated to get everyone home.
		<li><strong>Charge your phone</strong> – before you go out just in case you get separated from your friends or you need to call someone for help.
		<li><strong>Trust your instincts</strong> – if you don’t feel safe you probably aren’t.</li>
		<li><strong>Say no to violence</strong> – report violence or threats of violence to police.</li>
		<li><strong>Drink spiking</strong> – watch your drinks. Drink spiking happens - to girls and guys. To protect yourself, only accept drinks from people you don't know if they are unopened cans or bottles. Never leave your drink unattended and keep a thumb over the top of your bottle, if you are unsure if your drink has been spiked, leave it.</li>
		<li><strong>No means no</strong> – it’s OK to say no to sex and pressuring someone else into having sex is sexual assault and illegal. If there's any possibility that you may end up in bed with someone - carry a condom with you.</li>

	<h3>How many have you had?</h3>

	<p>Do you know what a <a href="http://alcohol.gov.au/internet/alcohol/publishing.nsf/Content/standard" target="_blank" title="Standard Drink information">standard drink</a> is? It's a measurement of alcohol and it isn't always the same as a bottle/can/glass. Most drinks are more than a single 'standard drink' so you could be consuming more than you think. Safe drinking guidelines are based on this measurement so it pays to know what they are. Set a limit at the start of the night and stick to it. Avoid topping up your drink so you can actually keep track.</p>

	<h3>Think before drinking</h3>

	<ul>

		<li><strong>Eat and drink water</strong> - if you drink alcohol make sure you eat beforehand, and drink water between alcoholic drinks. Spacing your drinks with water or soft drinks will keep you hydrated and in control. </li>
		<li><strong>Stay on the right side of the law </strong>- giving your friends who are under 18 alcohol is illegal. Penalties may apply. </li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Know what to do if you get in trouble</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Learn basic first aid </strong> –  if a friend is drunk or sick, stay with them. If they want to lie down, put them on their side in case they vomit.</li>
		<li><strong>Call triple zero (000)</strong> – if someone passes out or looks like they’re in trouble. Paramedics don’t need to involve the police.</li>
